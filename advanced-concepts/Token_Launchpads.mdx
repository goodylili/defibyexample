Since crypto is permissionless, anybody can create a new crypto token immediately. That is the power of tokenization.

DeFi is also permissionless, so your token can start trading immediately after you create it, at any valuation.

The crazy part is that you hardly need any technical expertise to do these, because there are token launchpads.

## What Is a Token Launchpad

Token launchpads are protocols that unify the experience of creating tokens and making tradable for anyone without needing to understand the blockchain. 

They streamline the experience of creating and managing tokens plus making them tradable on DEXs easy in just a few clicks.

Think about it like a token vending machine:

- Plug in the name of your project
- Choose your supply and distribution settings
- Set a launch date and price
- Click deploy

Boom! You have a token  and it’s ready to trade on a decentralized exchange (DEX).

Some launchpads also help with fundraising, token sales and distribution across multiple blockchains.

## How Token Launchpads Work

Behind the scenes, token launchpads handle all the technical heavy lifting that would otherwise require complex tasks like

Building smart contracts and deploying them on-chain. Setting up integrations with decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Raising Funding from the community and investors.

All you need to do is fill in the details and they take it from there.

## How to Create Tokens with a Token Launchpad

There are many token launchpads on Sui. Infact most DEXs have a token launchpad built-in.

In this tutorial we will use Steamm’s token launchpad to launch a token. Steamm makes it easy to create a token and liquidity pool in one click.

### Visit the Token Launchpad

Visit Steamm or whichever token launchpad you’re using and connect your wallet. Steamm’s launchpad is live at [steamm.fi/create](http://steamm.fi/create).

### Fill in the Token Details

Toggle between “Token & Pool” or Token only depending on what you want to do.

Fill in the token details, including the name, ticker, and icon, and execute the transaction that creates the pool.

### Let the Token Launchpad Cook

Wait for the token launchpad to set up the token. It would require you to sign transactions in multiple parts during the setup process.

### Your Token & Pool Is Live

Once your token and pool are live, you’ll get a confirmation from Steamm, including links to the transactions that created the token.

### View Liquidity Pool & Add Liquidity

Now that the process is complete, if you created a pool, you can view and manage the pool on Steamm.

Now you’ve seen how easy it is to launch a token from scratch and get it trading on a DEX. You can easily create liquidity pools on other DEXs when you launch your token as well.
