## Borrowing Tutorial

<Steps>
  <Step title="Toggle Borrowing" icon="toggle-right">
    Switch to the "Borrow" tab to see available assets for borrowing and their respective interest rates.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Supply Collateral" icon="shield">
    Before borrowing, you must provide collateral. Select an asset to use as collateral and deposit it into the protocol.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Borrow the Asset" icon="dollar-sign">
    After supplying collateral, you can borrow other assets. The amount you can borrow depends on the value of your collateral and the protocol's loan-to-value ratio.

    Select the asset you want to borrow, enter the amount (staying within your borrowing limit), and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Repay your Loans" icon="credit-card">
    To avoid liquidation, monitor your health factor and repay your loans on time. Toggle "Repay", select the borrowed asset, enter the amount you wish to repay, and confirm the transaction.

    Simply select the specific asset you borrowed and repay the loan.
