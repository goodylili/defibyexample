Now that you understand how lending and borrowing work, your next step is to try it out. 

This article will walk you through lending and borrowing on Scallop: a popular lending protocol on the Sui blockchain. The process is similar across major lending protocols, regardless of the blockchain you’re using.

## Lending Tutorial

### Visit the Lending Protocol

Visit the website of the lending protocol you want to lend to or borrow from. You can easily choose by comparing the APR across lending protocols.

Scallop is live at [Scallop.io](http://Scallop.io). Visit the app and connect your wallet to get started.

## Borrowing Tutorial

To borrow assets, you'll first need to supply collateral to secure your loan.

### Toggle Borrowing

Switch to the "Borrow" tab to see available assets for borrowing and their respective interest rates.

### Supply Collateral

Before borrowing, you must provide collateral. Select an asset to use as collateral and deposit it into the protocol.

### Borrow the Asset

After supplying collateral, you can borrow other assets. The amount you can borrow depends on the value of your collateral and the protocol's loan-to-value ratio.

Select the asset you want to borrow, enter the amount (staying within your borrowing limit), and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

### Repay your Loans

To avoid liquidation, monitor your health factor and repay your loans on time. Toggle "Repay”, select the borrowed asset, enter the amount you wish to repay, and confirm the transaction.

Simply select the specific asset you borrowed and repay the loan.
